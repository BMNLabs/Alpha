{"name":"Alpha","tagline":"We believe in working closely with stakeholders (end users, businesses, etc) during the development process and so we provide alpha state releases of some of our products here for interested parties to try and (hopefully) report bugs or request features.","body":"### Welcome to BMN Labs ###\r\n\r\nDeveloping security solutions for the current cybersecurity landscape is a very innovative field and we have many ideas on how we can help businesses defend themselves. Security software needs to be well designed, implemented and tested before being released as a v1.0. We are strong believers in the importance of involving our users in the development process and gathering their feedback as early as possible – our product development is driven by our users’ feedback.\r\n\r\n In that spirit we have created BMN Labs where interested parties can test and experiment with early stage technology and participate in it's development by reporting bugs or requesting features they would like to see implemented. Of course you should be aware that anything labeled alpha is not for production use and is very much a work in progress not yet ready for public consumption on any real scale. \r\n\r\nThank you for your support!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
